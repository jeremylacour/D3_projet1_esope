    <h1 id="right">THE LION AND<br>THE RAT</h1>
    <p>A lion slept ; a rat came there to scamper on its body. The lion, waking up, seizes him, and it was going to eat him, when the rat asked him to release him, promising, if he left him the life, to pay him of return. The lion began laughing and he let go. Then it happened that a little time after he had to his salute in the gratitudeof the rat. Hunters indeed took him and attached him to a tree with a rope. Then the rat hearing him to moan ran up, ate away at the rope and delivered him. " Formerly, he says, you laughed at me, because you did not wait for feedback from me; know now that to rats also we find of the gratitude. "</p>

    <h1 id="left">THE TORTOISE<br> AND THE HARE</h1>
    <p> The Hare considering the Tortoise who walked of a late step, and who dragged himself only with difficulty, began laughing at her and at its slowness. The Tortoise did not hear mockery, and tells him of a sour tone, that she challenged him, and that she would overcome him in the race, although he is proud of his lightness. The Hare accepted the challenge. They agreed together on the place where they had to run, and of the term of their race. The Fox was chosen by both parts to judge this dispute. The Tortoise set off, and the Hare to sleep, always believing to have time of rest to reach the Tortoise, and to arrive at the purpose before her. But finally she went to the purpose before the Hare was awakened. His nonchalance exposed him to the mockeries of the other Animals. The Fox, in fair Judge, gave the prize of the race to the Tortoise.</p>

    <h1 id="right">THE DOG AND<br>THE SHADOW</h1>
    <p>A dog holding a piece of meat crossed a river. Having perceived his shadow in the water, he believed that it was another dog which held a bigger piece of meat. So, releasing his, he dashed to remove that of his accomplice. But the result was that it had neither of them, the one being outside its grips, because there was not even, and an other one having been pulled by the current.</p>

    <p>On a beautiful winter day, a cicada met an ant, which aired grains in the sun. " Please, my good ant, feel sorry for me, says the cicada, and give me something to eat. I took nothing for a long time. " " And how did you arrive there? Asked the ant. What did you thus make all summer long? "
" This summer, answered the cicada, with the pride of the artist in the voice, I sang constantly. " " Very well, retorted her the ant, then this winter you are going to dance. "</p>

    <h1 id="right">THE OLD MAN AND DEATH</h1>
    <p>An old labourer, bent double with age and toil, was gathering sticks in a forest. At last he grew so tired and hopeless that he threw down the bundle of sticks, and cried out: "I cannot bear this life any longer. Ah, I wish Death would only come and take me!"
As he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to him: "What wouldst thou, Mortal? I heard thee call me."
"Please, sir," replied the woodcutter,"Would you kindly help me to lift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder?"</p>
